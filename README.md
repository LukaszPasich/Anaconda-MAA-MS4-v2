# _Anaconda_ Martial Arts Academy

_Anaconda_ Martial Arts Academy is a local school of martial arts located in Dublin 15, that teaches a combination of disciplines necessary to become a Mixed Martial Artist.
The goal of the academy however is not to train competition ready athletes but to help their members to get active and fit and receive all benefits of martial arts training, including building self-esteem and confidence.
The classes tought in the academy are: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Kickboxing and Boxing and also Mixed Martial Arts for the more advanced students.
Members can practice one chosen discipline or get involved with the whole MMA suite of disciplines.
The school accepts new members across all ages (in BJJ classes, kids can start as early as the age of 4) and various skill levels from Beginners to Advanced.
As 'Anaconda' academy is growing in members, they would like to automatise the process of signing up for memberships to and they would like to add a small e-commerce on their website to sell their branded merchandise.

### Surface

<br>

-	The Name - Why Anaconda?

	The martial art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - one of the staples of the academy - is in essence the skill of grappling, holding and taking down the opponent to then force them into submission via joint lock or chokehold.
	This very much resembles the actions of a constrictor snake and one of the submissions in BJJ is even called an _Anaconda Choke_. As grappling has become one of the key weapons in Mixed Martial Artist's arsenal, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu became near synonymous with MMA and that's why I thought it was a good name for this Martial Arts Academy.

<br>

- Logo

	With the logo I was trying to emulate the classic idea of the Martial Arts Club badge which seems to have always evolved around some related image or an Asian symbol enclosed in a circle (or lately popular octagon), with the club name and all the necessary text wrapped around that circle.

	Reference images:

	<img src="assets/images_readme/ms1-readme-ux-logoref.jpg" alt="Anaconda MAA website logo reference">

	Anaconda MAA final logo:

	<img src="assets/images_readme/ms1-readme-ux-logo.jpg" alt="Anaconda MAA logo">

<br>

- Colours

	Principally white, red and black colour palette.
	With black and white representing the concept of dualism, describing how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and the red colour being universally seen as a sign of both life and aggression - the 3 colours have always been used in martial arts themes.

	In my research of the competitor's websites, I discovered that these were the prevalent colours on all of those websites and the similar colour theme would also be possibly expected by the website user/ visitor. Meeting this expectation adds credibility to the brand, company and the website. 


	<img src="assets/images_readme/ms1-readme-ux-colours.jpg" alt="Anaconda MAA website colours">

<br>

- Typography

	Raleway: Semi-Bold, Bold and Extra Bold - for headlines and sub-headlines.

	_Raleway_ because it is a nice and clean display typeface and also geometric sans-serif fonts (as _Raleway_ being geometric inspired) tend to have more neutral feel about them.
	As Anaconda MAA aims at attracting a diverse audience, I didn't want to use font with too strong personality, because I wanted to convey an 'everybody is welcome' academy's approach to attracting it's new members.

	Roboto: Regular - for body text.

	_Roboto_ has forms that are largely geometric, but at the same time, the font features friendly and open curves - it is an excellent body text font and a good compliment to Raleway.
	Allowing letters to be settled into their natural width and with slab-serifs clearly defining the text baseline _Roboto_ creates an easy and more natural reading rhythm.


	Both fonts and also their combination has been tried and is well established and widely popular on the web.

<br>

- Images - Why black and white photography?

	Black and white photography removes any distraction of color and helps the viewer focus on other aspects of the photo, such as the subject, the textures, shapes and patterns, and the composition.
	It can convey remarkable purity of emotion and action and therefore works perfect for martial arts.

	}
	```	
	... you can get database_URL_from_Heroku in your app's _Settings_ tab (Reveal Cofig Vars - value for the DATABASE_URL key) or by typing <code>heroku config</code> in Heroku CLI.
10. With the new postgres database connected, migrations need to be run again, in CLI type in:

	```
	python3 manage.py migrate
	```	

11. Import all the data, type in CLI:

	```
	python3 manage.py loaddata db
	```	
	... where db is the name of the json file with fixtures. If there are multiple fixture files and some of them depend on other files, they should be loaded AFTER the files they depend on have been loaded.

12. Create superuser:

	```
	python3 manage.py createsuperuser
	```	
	... create username, enter email address and create password.

13. In settings.py delete current Heroku DATABASES config, uncomment previously commented out DATABASES config (you can safely push your code now and the postgres database url is not going to end up in version control) and put it in an _if statement_:
	```
	if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
	else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
	```	

14. Instal gunicorn (acts as a webserver), in CLI:
	```
	pip3 install gunicorn
	```	
	...then freeze requirements:
	```
	pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
	```

15. Create Procfile at project level, inside the file type in on the first line:
	```
	web: gunicorn your_app_name.wsgi:application
	```
	... your_app_name is the name of the project - the name of the folder where settings.py file is.

16. Login to Heroku - in CLI: heroku login (or heroku login -i and give email and password of the superuser).


17. Temporarily disable collect static by typing in CLI:
	```
	heroku config: set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app name_of_the_app
	```
	... name_of_the_app in heroku.


18. Add the hostname of heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py:
	```
	ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['app_name_in_heroku.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
	```

19. Commit changes and push to GitHub.

20. Push to Heroku, in CLI type in:
	```
	git push heroku main
	```
	... if the app was created on the website (fatal: 'heroku' does not appear to be a git repository), heroku git remote may need to be initialized:
	```
	heroku git:remote -a app_name_in_heroku 
	```
	... and then type again in CLI: git push heroku main

21. After few seconds at the end of the load up, the heroku link to the app will be ready.

22. To set for automatic deploy when pushed, go to Heroku _Deploy_ tab:
- click _Connect to Github_
- enter the name of the app in search bar (name of the GitHub repositoiry) - click "Search"
- click "Connect" to the repository
- below, click "Enable Automatic Deploys" - whenever code is pushed to GitHub now, it will automatically be pushed to Heroku as well.

23. Go to [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) and generate a new key - copy the key.
Go to Heroku _Settings_ tab, _Reveal Config Vars_ and add a new _Config Var_ with key: SECRET_KEY, and value: paste the key from Django Secret Key Generator.

24. In settings.py replace SECRET_KEY with the call to get it from environment:
	```
	SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
	```

25. In settings.py set DEBUG to be True only if there's a variable DEVELOPMENT in the environment. 
	```
	DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
	```

- DATABASE_URL
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
- EMAIL_HOST_USER
- SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
